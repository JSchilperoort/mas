        <h1 class="mt-4">Rules</h1>

        In addition to the aforementioned card-specific actions, there are three more actions that can always be taken. All possible actions are: <br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>Income: take one coin from the bank.</li>
          <li>Foreign Aid: take two coins from the bank, can be blocked by the duke.</li>
          <li>Coup: spend seven coins to make one chosen player give up one of their influence cards.</li>
          <li>Taxes: take three coins from the bank(duke ability).</li>
          <li>Assassinate: spend three coins to make one chosen player give up one of their influence cards (assassin ability).</li>
          <li>Steal: take two coins from another player. Can be blocked with a captain (captain ability).</li>
        </ul>



      </div>

      <div class="container-fluid">
        <h1 class="mt-4">Actions, blocks and challenges</h1>

        <p>As the game is played, many actions, blocks and challenges are encountered. As a card-specific action is played, that player claims to have the proper influence card to do so. This can be challenged by all other players. Whenever an action is played that can be blocked, all players are allowed to block the action. By blocking, they claim to have the proper influence card to do so. This can be challenged by the players whos action is being blocked.</p>
	    <p>When a challenge takes place, the player that is challenged has to reveal an influence card. If this is the influence card that she has claimed to have, the challenge is unsuccessful. The influence card is shuffled into the deck and a new one is drawn. The challenging player loses an influence card that is revealed to everyone and the original action or block will go through as intended. However, if she does not show the claimed influence card, the challenge is successful. She will lose the revealed influence card. The block or action that was challenged will not go through.</p>
        <p>As players spend and gain coins from the bank or each other, they will be able to afford assassinations and coups. These actions, in addition to challenges will reduce the number of influence cards players have. When a player loses both her influence cards, she is 'dead', and quits the game. The last player standing wins the game.</p>
