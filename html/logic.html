        <h1 class="mt-4">Epistemic Logic in Coup</h1>
        <p>In our implementation of the card game we have used several of the subjects that are part of the course material. We have also deliberately refrained from using some parts of the material that might at first seem applicable. Additionally, we have implemented the concept of lying public announcements which is not part of the course material, but is discussed in the 2014 paper by Hans van Ditmarsch, Dynamics of lying. First we will discuss what parts of epistemic logic we readily used as it was presented in the course. Secondly we will argue why we have not used action models, even though they could be seen as a natural fit for Coup. Finally we will discuss some logic from Dynamics of lying, and explain why we chose to use what we did.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Course Material</h4>
		<p>Most importantly, we have chosen to define a Kripke model for our game, which is updated whenever appropriate. From her accessible worlds in a Kripke model,a player can determine whether she can successfully challenge another player, and when she can play an action that is not at risk of being successfully blocked.</p>
	    <p>In Coup, most knowledge is shared by all players at all times. Therefore we are dealing with common knowledge. Common knowledge in Coup includes the number of coins each player has, and all influence cards that are turned face-up. The size and composition of the deck are also part of common knowledge. In order to keep the Kripke model as simple as possible, this common knowledge is not explicitly included in the model. This would unnecessarily include statements to every single world. Therefore the face-up influence cards, composition of the deck and coin counts are defined as global variables rather than factual statements true in all possible worlds. It is important to note that Common knowledge does change, but this is not the same as changing common knowledge throughout a run depending on the internal state of the agents, as we have seen in class.</p>
        <p>Apart from our common knowledge, there is private knowledge about an agent's own cards, that will always remain completely private. Therefore our Kripke model strongly resembles a distributed system, where the knowledge of all agents is about their own influence card types, and no knowledge can be acquired about other agents' influence cards. As such, all worlds have reflexive accessibility relations for all agents, and all accessibility relations go both ways. However, only possible worlds that are in agreement with the actual world for at least one player, are taken into account. This saves the game from generating the vast amount of worlds that do not agree with any of the agent's private knowledge. Worlds that are not allowed because of common knowledge, for example a world containing 4 assassins, are excluded as well. We are justified in cutting our number of possible worlds in this way because almost the entirety of the game the state of the actual world does not change. For the exception when a player shuffles his card into the deck and draws a new one, a completely new Kripke model is generated. This is logically speaking not the most elegant solution, but necessary to keep the size of the Kripke model feasible.</p>
        <p>When any type of action occurs that changes knowledge, we have modelled the consequences with announcement logic. In the case of common knowledge as described above, this is modelled by a public announcement, or a a public update. The common knowledge acquired through this update is added to the common knowledge pool. Private knowledge that is acquired or changed, is modelled by a private update, only changing the accessibility relations for that player. After an update, possible worlds that have no accessibility relations going to them except for reflexive ones, is discarded.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Action models</h4>
		<p>Since the progression of a turn is a series of actions that can be taken by one or more players, it might seem natural to make use of action models. However, the actions taken in Coup have some interesting properties. Whatever action is chosen, all players are aware what action has taken place. Therefore a hypothetical action model would have no accessibility relations between any of the actions, and they would effectively function as separate action models. We would therefore only make use of action models with a single action. Additionally, the effect of such a publicly chosen action will always be public as well. Therefore any action model can be implemented equivalently by a public update in Coup.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Dynamics of Lying</h4>
		<p>A big part of Coup is 'bluffing' or in proper epistemic speak, making lying public announcements. We use terminology from the paper by Hans van Ditmarsch. In the paper a distinction is made between truthful public announcements [!p], lying public announcements [¡p] and bluffing public announcements [!¡p]. Whenever an action or block takes place, this is implemented as a truthful or lying public announcement, when an agent does or does not have the corresponding influence card, respectively. Bluffing public announcements take place when the announcing agent does not know whether p. Bluffing public announcements can only take place in Coup when an agent decides to challenge an action or block, without being able to infer from his knowledge whether or not the challenge will be successful.</p>
        <p>In the article a strong distinction is made between outside observer to agent(s) announcements, and agent to agent announcements. In the case of agent to agent announcements, these are notably different since, when believed, will yield not only new information for the addressee but also beliefs about the knowledge of the announcer. Since in our implementation beliefs of any kind are excluded, and knowledge about other agents' knowledge is contained in the common knowledge only, all announcements can effectively be modelled as outside observer public announcements. </p>
